# Module_9_Surf-s_UP

# 1.	Overview of the analysis: 
•	The primary purpose of this analysis is to understand weather trends in the month of June and December in Oahu. This will help in determining if it is financially feasible to open a surf/ice cream shop year-round given the weather conditions.

# 2.	Results:
•	In the month of June, the average temperature was 74.5, while in December the average temperature was 71 degrees.
•	In June the minimum temperature was found to be 65 degrees, and 56 in December. 
•	The max temperature was 83 in December and 85 in June.  

# 3.	Summary: 
•	Based on the results of the analysis, it would be feasible to host the surf/ ice cream shop year-round. Comparatively between June and December there was only a 3-degree difference in temperature. This is a good sign that even December, which should be the coldest month of the year, the interest in the two primary shop products would still be in demand. 
•	There is a higher degree of difference between the coldest temperatures charted. In December the minimum degree was 56, while in June it was 65. However, this 10-degree difference is the minimum and it is possible these temperatures will not drastically affect the overall productivity of the shop.
